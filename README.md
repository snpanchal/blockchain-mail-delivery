# blockchain-mail-delivery
Decentralized application to track mail and packages from sender to recipient.

This application uses the Ethereum blockchain as a back-end, and the smart contract is written in Solidity. Since this application is decentralized, it does not rely on any servers. The front-end of this application is built using React.js, and any updates to the blockchain data source will result in real time updates of this application.

Currently, this application runs on the Ropsten test network and the Ethereum address for the smart contract is *0xAe3342638091Ad31BFf7FF8d45f8bE95ed6383DD*.

To run this application, clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory:
`npm start`
